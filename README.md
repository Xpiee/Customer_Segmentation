# Customer Segmentation for Online Retail

For the past 10 years, we have witnessed a steady and strong increase of online retail sales. According to the Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG),
online shoppers in the United Kingdom spent an estimated £50 billion in year 2011,
a more than 5000 per cent increase compared with year 20001. This remarkable increase of online sales indicates that
the way consumers shop for and use financial services has fundamentally changed.
Compared with traditional shopping in retail stores, online shopping has some unique characteristics: each customer's
shopping process and activities can be tracked instantaneously and accurately, each customer's order is usually
associated with a delivery address and a billing address, and each customer has an online store account with essential
contact and payment information. These desirable, special online shopping characteristics have enabled online
retailers to treat each customer as an individual with personalized understanding of each customer and to build upon
customer-centric business intelligence. In relation to customer-centric business intelligence, online retailers are usually
concerned with the following common business concerns:

1. Who are the most/least valuable customers to the business? What are the distinct characteristics of them?
2. Who are the most/least loyal customers, and how are they characterized?
3. What are customers’ purchase behavior patterns? Which products/items have customers purchased together
often? In which sequence the products have been purchased?
4. Which types of customers are more likely to respond to a certain promotion mailing?


RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis2 is a marketing technique used to determine quantitatively which
customers are the best ones by examining how recently a customer has purchased (recency), how often they purchase
(frequency), and how much the customer spends (monetary). RFM analysis is based on the marketing axiom that "80%
of your business comes from 20% of your customers." With the advent of e-mail marketing campaigns and customer
relationship management software, RFM ratings have become an important tool. Using RFM analysis, customers are
assigned a ranking number of 1,2,3,4, or 5 (with 5 being highest) for each RFM parameter. The three scores together
are referred to as an RFM "cell". The database is sorted to determine which customers were "the best customers" in
the past, with a cell ranking of "555" being ideal.

Although RFM analysis is a useful tool, it does have its limitations. A company must be careful not to over-solicit
customers with the highest rankings. Experts also caution marketers to remember that customers with low cell rankings
should not be neglected, but instead should be cultivated to become better customers.
